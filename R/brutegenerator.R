#' Brute force color coding scheme generator
#'
#' Generates "color" coding schemes used to mark and identify individual animals. The codes are robust to an arbitrary number of partial erasures. This method uses a sloppy, very slow, stochastic brute force method.
#'
#'
#' @param total.length the number of unique positions to be marked on the animal. (This can be thought of as the total number of positions on which color bands or paint marks will be applied.)
#' @param redundancy the number of erasures that can occur without disrupting surety of unique identification. This value determines how robust the scheme is to erasures.
#' @param alphabet an integer representing the 'alphabet size.' This is the number of unique markings (think different paint colors, symbols, or varieties of bands) at your disposal.Note: unlike the Reed-Solomon inspired function, \code{\link{rs_IDs}}, this function can take non-prime values.
#' @param num.tries the number of iterations that will be run before choosing the best option. Increasing this number increases the running time.
#' @param available.colors an optional list of strings that contains the names of the unique markings which compose the given 'alphabet' (e.g. "blue", "red", "yellow", etc.). If left blank, the mapping can be done at any later time using \code{\link{codes_to_colors}}. Additionally, the length of this list must match the 'alphabet size' given above.
#'
#' @details This function generates the list of all possible unique ID codes given the 'alphabet size' (\code{alphabet}) and the number of unique positions available for marking (\code{total.length}). The list of combinations is then iteratively pruned down until the required robustness has been reached; the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance}{distance} between any two ID codes must greater than the value specified in \code{redundancy}.
#'
#' However, the iterative pruning is done randomly, so it is likely that resulting list of codes does not contain the maximum possible number of robust codes. Thus, the process is repeated multiple times (\code{num.tries}) and the list that contains the largest number of robust codes is kept and returned.
#'
#'
#' @return a list of unique ID codes that fit the provided parameters.
#'
#' If an appropriate argument for \code{available.colors} is provided, each code will be a sequence of strings, otherwise, each code will be a sequence of numeric values.
#'
#' @note  the \code{\link{rs_IDs}} function always generates the maximum number of unique codes per scheme. However, \code{\link{rs_IDs}} suffers from certain limitations that \code{\link{brute_IDs}} does not: it requires \code{alphabet} to be a prime number, \code{total.length} to be less than or equal to \code{alphabet}, etc.
